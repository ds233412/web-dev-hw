    <h1>Method</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Sauté onions and carrots:</b> Melt the butter in a soup pot over medium heat and cook the onions and carrots, stirring occasionally, until the onions soften, about 5 to 8 minutes. Do not let the onions or carrots brown. Sprinkle a teaspoon of salt over the carrots and onions as they cook.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><b>Add stock and water, ginger, and strips of orange zest.</b> Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the carrots soften, about 20 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><b>Remove the strips of orange zest!</b> It's easy to forget this step, and if you forget and purée the soup with the strips of zest still in it, the soup may be too bitter for your taste.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><b>Purée soup:</b> Purée the soup with a stick blender, or working in small batches, pour the soup into a blender and purée until completely smooth. Only fill the blender bowl a third full with the hot liquid and keep one hand pressing down on the cap of the blender to keep it from popping off.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li> Add more salt to taste, and garnish with chopped chives, parsley, or fennel fronds.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>We use chicken stock in this recipe, but you can easily use vegetable stock for a vegetarian option.</p><br>
  <blockquote>
    According to Dr. Mercola, “A serving of carrots (one medium carrot or ½ cup chopped) will provide about: 210% of the average daily recommended amount of vitamin, 10% vitamin K, 6% vitamin C, and 2% calcium.”  Ginger may help to protect brain function, may inhibit some forms of cancer, fend off respiratory viruses and clear up congestion, and offer bacterial benefits against some types of drug-resistant bacteria,  when combined with garlic and lime.<br/>

I love that it’s so creamy without the dairy. The only sad part is by skipping the water, I will only get 2 servings."</td>

  <td style="width: 1000px;">&nbsp;Sandy S said, "Such a tasty and easy soup to whip together. Lovely gentle flavor and ‘creaminess’ sans any milk or milk substitute. Great for anytime one needs to go lightly on their diet for whatever reason, like recovering from illness or taking a break from too many spicy ingredients. This said, when I reheated the leftovers the next day, I added a cup of pumpkin puree along with a blend of curry, turmeric and black pepper with quite satisfying results. This is a good soup recipe to fall back on when the cupboard is bare and/or time is scarce. I can easily see adding such things as grated parsnips and/or boiled peanuts to stretch it if needed."</td>
