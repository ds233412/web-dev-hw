    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
    <pre>
      My mama called, seen you on TV, son
      Said shit done changed ever since we was on
      I dreamed it all ever since I was young
      They said I wouldn't be nothing
      Now they always say congratulations
      Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
      They ain't never had the dedication
      People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
      Yeah, we made it
    </pre>
    <pre>
      They was never friendly, yeah
      Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
      And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
      But I knew I had to have it, yeah
      For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
      Got me itching like a habit, yeah
      I'm surrounded twenty bad bitch, yeah
      But they didn't know me last year, yeah
      Everyone wanna act like they important
      (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
      But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
      (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
      Everyone counting on me drop the ball
      (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
      Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
      If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
      How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
      Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
      Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
    </pre>
    <pre>
      My mama called, seen you on TV, son
      Said shit done changed ever since we was on
      I dreamed it all ever since I was young
      They said I wouldn't be nothing
      Now they always say congratulations
      Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
      They ain't never had the dedication
      People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
      Yeah, we made it
